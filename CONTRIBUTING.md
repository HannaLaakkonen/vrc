## Creating a new virtual reference collection

Follow the steps below to create a new virtual reference collection. If you encounter a problem creating a new
virtual reference collection you can open an [issue](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/issues) or you can ask 
questions in the [discussions](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/discussions) section.

- In a separate browser tab, naviagte to the [collections directory](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/tree/main/collections)
  of this repository.
- Click on the "Add File" drop down menu in the top right hand side of the page.
- Click "+ Create new file".
- Click the green button that says "Fork this repository".
- In the box at the top of the page (where it says "Name your file..."), enter a name for the collection file ending with
  a `.yml` file extension. It is not important what the name is, but you cannot use a name that has already been used
  before and it must have a `.yml` file extension. Check the
  [collections directory](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/tree/main/collections) if you are unsure.
- In a separate browser tab, navigate to the the 
  [virtual reference collection template file](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/blob/main/vrc-template.yml) and copy its
  contents to your clipboard.
- Paste the template's contents into the edit window of your new collection file (where it says "Enter file contents here").
- Replace the text for the fields as instructed in the template, ensuring you maintain the field names, formating and
  indentation of the template. Check other collection files in the
  [collections directory](https://github.com/luomus/vrc/tree/main/collections) if you are unsure.
- Click the green button in upper right hand corner that says "Commit changes..".
- In the dialog box that opens, optionally edit the commit message and add an extended description if you want.
- Click the green button that says "Propose Changes".
- In the new page that opens click the green button in the upper right hand corner that says "Create pull request".
- Another page should open where you can adjust the title and description to something other than your commit message
  and extended description if you want.
- In the lower right hand corner click the green button that says "Create pull request"
- You should now have sucessfully submitted a new virtual reference collection to the library. A reviewer will look over your
  proposal and contact you via GitHub if needed. You can use the current page to track the progress of the review and leave
  comments or reply to feedback if needed.
- Once your new virtual reference collection has passed the review it will be visible in the
  [collection libary](https://luomus.github.io/vrc).
